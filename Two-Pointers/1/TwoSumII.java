/**
 * PROBLEM: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
 * * Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, 
 * find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. 
 * Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.
 * * Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.
 * The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.
 * Your solution must use only constant extra space.
 * * Example:
 * Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
 * Output: [1,2]
 * Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
